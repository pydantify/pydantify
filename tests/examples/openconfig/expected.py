    For system-controlled interfaces, this leaf is the
    device-specific name of the interface.  The 'config false'
    list interfaces/interface[name]/state contains the currently
    existing interfaces on the device.

    If a client tries to create configuration for a
    system-controlled interface that is not present in the
    corresponding state list, the server MAY reject
    the request if the implementation does not support
    pre-provisioning of interfaces or if the name refers to

     configuration, the 'pre-provisioning' feature is

     If the device allows arbitrarily named user-controlled
     interfaces, the 'arbitrary-names' feature is advertised.

    When a configured user-controlled interface is created by
    the system, it is instantiated with the same name in the

    If a client tries to set the type of an interface to a

    MIB object.  Such an implementation needs to use some
    mechanism to handle the differences in size and characters
    allowed between this leaf and ifAlias.  The definition of
    such a mechanism is outside the scope of this document.

    Since ifAlias is defined to be stored in non-volatile
    storage, the MIB implementation MUST map ifAlias to the
    value of 'description' in the persistently stored
    datastore.

    Specifically, if the device supports ':startup', when
    ifAlias is read the device MUST return the value of
    'description' in the 'startup' datastore, and when it is
    written, it MUST be written to the 'running' and 'startup'
    datastores.  Note that it is up to the implementation to

    decide whether to modify this single leaf in 'startup' or
    perform an implicit copy-config from 'running' to

    Initialization:
    - all values have to be set via keyword arguments
